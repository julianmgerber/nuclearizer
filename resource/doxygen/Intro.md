# Introduction to Nuclearizer

This page provides the source code documentation for COSI’s main calibration tool, Nuclearizer.

The first version of Nuclearizer was developed for COSI’s 2009 Fort Sumner balloon flight (when the project was still known as NCT).
A second version was created for COSI’s 2014 Antarctica flight.
Since then, the tool has undergone several reorganizations and refactorings, but its core design remains the same.

Nuclearizer is built on MEGAlib’s Fretalon calibration framework,
so this documentation includes both Nuclearizer and Fretalon classes.
